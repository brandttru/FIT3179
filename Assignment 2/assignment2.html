                The Internaional Math Olympiad (IMO) is an annual competition for pre-university students from around the world. The first IMO was held in 1959 in Romania. More than 100 countries participate, with each country sending a team of up to six students, plus one leader, a deputy leader and observers. Due to its emphasis on nationality and gender, there can be underlying trends found in the relationships between nationality, gender and results.
